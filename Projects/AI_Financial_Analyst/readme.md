Building an AI Financial Analyst with the Assistants API
In this guide, we discuss how to build an AI financial analyst using the Assistants API, function calling, and Code Interpreter.


Assistants API:

An Assistant has instructions and can leverage models, tools, and knowledge to respond to user queries. The Assistants API currently supports three types of tools: Code Interpreter, Retrieval, and Function calling. 
In this guide, we'll look at how to build a financial analyst assistant using parallel function calling and the Assistants API. After setting that up, we'll also extend it to use Code Interpreter in order to visualize the data from our API calls.

Function calling:

Function calling allows you to describe functions to the Assistants and have it intelligently return the functions that need to be called along with their arguments.
For this example, we'll use the Financial Modeling Prep API and retrieve real-time financial data for the following endpoints:

Key metrics
Financial ratios
Financial growth
Financial statements (i.e. income statements, balance sheet, & cash flow statement)
By making each of these API calls available to our financial assistant, it will be able to retrieve data based on the user's question, analyze the results, and respond accordingly.

Also, since we now have parallel function calling, we can analyze multiple stocks for specific data with a single input. For example, you could ask questions like:

Compare the financial health of Microsoft and Apple over the last four years, focusing on their balance sheets and key financial ratios
Evaluate Amazon's financial growth trajectory over the past five quarters. Highlight key metrics and cash flow trends that indicate its growth pattern.

Overview of the Assistants API
Before we get into the code, let's briefly review the steps of creating an Assistant.

The Assistants API enables us to build specialized AI agents with distinct capabilities.
By combining Assistants with function calling, these agents can translate natural language into API calls, process the data from these API calls, and provide analyses based on the response.

Steps to Create a Financial Analyst Assistant
At a high-level, the steps we need to take to create an Assistant are:

Defining financial functions: We need to define the Financial Modeling Prep API calls to retrieve financial
Defining the Assistant: Our AI agent will use models and instructions alongside the function calling tool to retrieve & analyze financial data.
Creating a Thread: A thread is essentially a conversation flow where we can feed the agent with user queries, function call responses, and assistant replies.
Adding Messages: We then input user queries to the Thread in the form of Messages.
Running the Assistant: We then create a Run, which is the Assistant processing the Thread, calling necessary tools, and generating appropriate responses.
